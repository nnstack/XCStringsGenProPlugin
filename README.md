**XCStringsGenProPlugin** is a lightweight yet powerful tool designed to automate the generation and maintenance of type-safe user-facing strings from String Catalog(s). Seamlessly integrating into your Xcode workflow, this plugin saves time, reduces errors, and ensures consistency across your localization files.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository includes a pre-compiled binary of XCStringsGen to avoid compilation, reduce build times, and simplify dependencies.
> For developers who want to modify the code, refer to the [source code version](https://github.com/nonasim/XCStringsGenPlugin).

## Motivation

Localization using String Catalogs should be seamless, not a source of friction. This tool simplifies working with string catalogs while using familiar terminologies, eliminating the need for additional learning. With a type-safe approach, accessing localized strings becomes intuitive, reducing errors and improving maintainability. Say goodbye to hardcoded keys and manual string management—this tool ensures a smoother, more efficient localization workflow.

## Installation

### Option 2: Integrating into your Swift package

1. Open `Package.swift` file
2. Add it as package dependency:
```swift
dependencies: [
 .package(url: "https://github.com/nonasim/XCStringsGenProPlugin.git", from: "1.0.0"),
],
```
3. Add as build tool plugin for the target:
```swift
.target(
    name: "AppCore",
    ...
    plugins: [
        .plugin(name: "XCStringsGenProPlugin", package: "XCStringsGenProPlugin"),
    ]
)
```

## Usage

When building the project for the first time after adding the plugin, you may encounter a build error stating "XCStringsGenPlugin" is disabled. To proceed, click the error in the Issue Navigator, review the plugin, enable the plugin and then build again.

Once the build process is complete, you should be able to see the file path through **Report navigator** under **Run custom shell script 'XCStringsGen: Code generation'**. This tells you that the file has been generated and its attributes can be referenced from the code.

In case you want to take a look at the file, you can open it through the file path above OR you can jump to the file from any reference from code using options like **Command(⌘) + Click** since this is compiled as part of the target.

Based on the entries in your String Catalog, the plugin generates a localized `L10n` enum which you can access as follows:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var username: String = "Alice"
    @State private var notificationCount: Int = 5
    @State private var balance: Double = 1234.56
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Welcome to the app!
            Text(L10n.welcomeMessage)
            
            // Hello, %@! We're glad to see you.
            Text(L10n.greetings(username))
            
            // You have %d new notifications.
            Text(L10n.notificationMessage(notificationCount))
            
            // %@, you have %d unread messages and your account balance is $%.2f.
            Text(L10n.summary(username, notificationCount, balance))
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

```

The plugin also supports multiple String Catalogs. If you have two or more String Catalogs then the filename is used as a namespace. This is how that looks:
```swift
Text(L10n.Onboarding.greetings(username))
Text(L10n.Settings.generalNote)
```
